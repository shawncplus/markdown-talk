Uses a patched version of https://github.com/arturadib/strapdown which supports a 'source' tag, along with some extra features to navigate the tutorial files I tend to generate which are bulleted list outlines of the content.

Features
* Base styles to make things look _generally_ better than the default slate theme
* j/k navigation highlighting the current talking point
* That's pretty much all I need. I mean, it just renders a markdown file pretty-like and lets me display it in a highly readable way for presentations
